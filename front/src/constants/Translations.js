                            Football 
                            Football, known as the most popular sport globally, takes place on a large rectangular field where two teams of eleven players each compete. The goal is to score the most goals by directing the ball into the opposing goal, primarily using the feet, but also using other parts of the body except the hands and arms. 
                            Basketball 
                            Basketball is played on a rectangular court with two teams of five players each, aiming to score points by throwing a ball through a high hoop fixed to a backboard at each end of the court. This fast-paced game is characterized by its intensity and dynamic movements, as well as sophisticated passing and shooting techniques. 
                            Tennis 
                            Tennis is a racket sport played on a rectangular court divided by a net. Players, in singles or doubles, score points by striking a ball with their racket so that the opponent cannot return it validly. This sport is renowned for its elegance, intense duels, and technical precision. 
                            Explore these disciplines and many more on our platform, where passion and performance meet to create unforgettable moments. The Olympic Games celebrate sporting excellence, fair play, and international unity through these historic competitions.
