### Technical Documentation: Olympic Ticket Sales Application

#### 1. Introduction
This document describes the architecture, features, and security considerations of the Olympic ticket sales application. The application uses React for the front end and Java Spring Boot for the back end. It complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and emphasizes data and transaction security.

#### 2. Application Architecture
The application's architecture is based on a clear separation between the front end and the back end, facilitating development, maintenance, and future evolution.

##### 2.1 Front-End
- **Framework**: React
- **Languages**: JavaScript and TypeScript
- **Directory Structure**:
  - **DOM Elements**: Contains React components.
  - **Core Elements**: Defines business models (e.g., clients, tickets).
  - **Links and Functionality**: Contains algorithms and application logic.

##### 2.2 Back-End
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Language**: Java
- **Directory Structure**:
  - **Controllers**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Services**: Contains business logic.
  - **Repositories**: Manages database interactions.

##### 2.3 Database
- **Type**: Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- **Main Data Models**:
  - **User**: Manages user information and permissions.
  - **Ticket**: Manages ticket information (e.g., event, price, availability).

#### 3. Application Security
Security is a critical aspect of the application. Here are the main security measures implemented:

##### 3.1 Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for user authentication and API security.
- **OAuth2**: Supported for authentication via third-party providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

##### 3.2 Data Security
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) is encrypted using AES-256.
- **SSL/TLS**: All communications between the client and server are secured via HTTPS.

##### 3.3 Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities
- **XSS Prevention**: Using libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize user inputs.
- **CSRF Prevention**: Implementing CSRF tokens to protect forms.
- **Validation and Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injections and other types of injections.

##### 3.4 Monitoring and Auditing
- **Logs**: Detailed logs are maintained to track suspicious activities.
- **Audit**: Regular security and permission audits are conducted.

#### 4. GDPR Compliance
The application adheres to the basic principles of GDPR, including:

##### 4.1 Consent
- Users must give explicit consent for the collection and processing of their data.

##### 4.2 Right of Access and Rectification
- Users can access their personal data and request corrections or deletions.

##### 4.3 Data Portability
- Users can request a copy of their data in a portable format (e.g., CSV).

##### 4.4 Data Security
- Personal data is protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.

#### 5. Future Developments
To improve and extend the application's features, here are some future development ideas:

##### 5.1 New Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for multiple languages to reach an international audience.
- **Notifications**: Integrate an email and SMS notification system to inform users about updates and promotions.

##### 5.2 Security Enhancements
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Strengthen user account security.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor malicious activities in real-time.

##### 5.3 Scalability
- **Caching**: Use caching solutions (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
- **Microservices**: Decompose the application into microservices to facilitate deployment and scalability.

##### 5.4 Advanced Technologies Integration
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Use AI to analyze user behavior and provide personalized recommendations.
- **Blockchain**: Explore the use of blockchain to secure ticket transactions and combat fraud.

#### 6. Conclusion
This technical documentation covers the key aspects of the Olympic ticket sales application, with a particular focus on security and GDPR compliance. The proposed future developments will enhance the features and further strengthen the application's security.
